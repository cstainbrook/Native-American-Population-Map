# Native American Population Map

### What's in this Repo
This repo contains the code for an interactive map I made, which visualizes the Native American population by county for the years 2009-2015.

### Replicating the Project

#### [Get Census API Key](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)

#### Add Key to JavaScript Code
In native_map_head.js and native_map_body.js, replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with the api key you received.

#### Set up a local server
In the command line, navigate to the directory where the files are located.  Then run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.  This sets up a local server, which can be accessed by using a web browser and typing localhost:8000 in the url bar.

#### Run native_map.html
In the web browser, click on the link for native_map.html
